# pop_pac (BETA version) #
pop_pac is an EEGLAB plug-in to compute phase-amplitude coupling. 
While the plug-in is still in its early Beta Version, usage and feedback is encouraged.
In addition to the traditional methods to compute PAC, the plugin include the Instantaneuous
and Event-Related implementation of the Mutual Information Phase-Amplitude Coupling Method (Martinez-Cancino et al 2018, Article in preparation).
The toolbox is developed the Swartz Center for Computational Neurosciences, UCSD, La Jolla, California
